# @thesoulfresh/interactors
Interactors and matchers for use with [@interactors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@interactors/html) (a.k.a. **bigtest**).

All interactors provided by this package work against ARIA semantics so
if your tests are passing, your accessibility is also decent (though that's
no replacement for actual accessibility testing).
